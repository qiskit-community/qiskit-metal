# Guide

A collection of ready-to-execute Jupyter Notebooks, intended to help you dive right into the tool usage and the coding deep understanding.

WORK IN PROGRESS - **This is an early-access alpha version of Qiskit Metal.** This folder will be expanded throughout the early-access period, based on both planned training and your feedback. Please let us know about anything you might want us to add or elaborate upon.

Also feel free to directly contribute to the content of these folders. If you plan to submit notebooks, please clear the cells from any generated image, to minimize the repo data footprint.
