    "This tutorial describes how to use the Cooper Pair Box Hamiltonian (HCPB) class in Qiskit Metal to model the interaction between a transmon qubit and a CPW resonator. We will build the so-called Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian and then perform some analysis. \n",

    "The basic form of the interaction Hamiltonian has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H = H_{transmon} + H_{CPW} + H_{interaction}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "While we could model both the transmon and the CPW as harmonic oscillators, we'll use the HCPB class in Qiskit Metal to model the transmon and we'll model the CPW as just a regular harmonic oscillator using ladder operators defined in QuTiP. The resulting Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian will then have the form: \n",

    "$H = H_{transmon} + \\omega_{r} a^{\\dagger} a + gN(a+a^{\\dagger})  $\n",

    "where $\\omega_{r}$ is the resonator frequency, $a$ and $a^{\\dagger}$ are the annihilation and creation operators, respectively, for photons in the resonator cavity, g is the transmon-cavity coupling and $N$ is the charge number operator of the transmon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll construct the above Hamiltonian using the HCPB class in Qiskit Metal and QuTiP. Then we study how the system evolves in time using the QuTiP master equation solver. We'll add some photon dissipation to the CPW resonator and show that impacts the dynamics. "
