.. attention::

    **v0.5 transition in progress.** Qiskit Metal is officially becoming **Quantum Metal**.
    The Python import path remains ``qiskit_metal`` for now; a follow-up release will update it.
    The PyPI package ``qiskit-metal`` stays archived at the pre-0.5 state—install v0.5 **from source**
    via the :doc:`installation </installation>` guide.
    For details on the transition and the roadmap, see the :doc:`Roadmap </workflow>`.

.. rubric:: **Qiskit Metal Vision**:

Designing quantum devices is the bedrock of the quantum ecosystem,
but it is a difficult, multi-step process that connects traditionally disparate worlds.
Metal is automating and streamlining this process.
Our vision is to develop a community-driven universal platform capable
of orchestrating quantum chip development from concept to fabrication in
a simple and open framework.

We want to accelerate, and to lower the barrier to, innovation of  quantum devices.
Today at the IEEE Quantum Week Conference, the team discussed their vision for this first-of-its-kind project. Led by quantum physicist Zlatko Minev and
developed with other IBM Quantum team members, this project is meant for those interested in quantum hardware design: a suite of design automation
tools that can be used to devise and analyze superconducting devices, with a focus on being able to integrate the best tools into a quantum hardware
designer’s workflow. We’ve code-named the project Qiskit Metal.

We hope that as a community, we might make the process of quantization — bridging the gap between pieces of a superconducting metal on a quantum chip
with the computational mathematics of Hamiltonians and Hilbert spaces — available to anyone with a curious mind and a laptop. We want to make quantum
device design a streamlined process that automates the laborious tasks as it does with conventional electronic device design. We are writing software
with built-in best practices and cutting-edge quantum analysis techniques, all this while seamlessly leveraging the power of conventional EDA tools.
The goal of Qiskit Metal is to allow for easy quantum hardware modeling with reduction of design-related errors plus increased speed.
