Qiskit Metal (|version|)
########################

Qiskit Metal is an EDA tool for quantum device design.

ATTENTION: This is an early-access alpha version of Qiskit Metal. This folder will be expanded throughout the early-access period, based on both planned training and your feedback. Please let us know about anything you might want us to add or elaborate upon. 

Designing quantum devices is the bedrock of the quantum ecosystem, but it is a difficult, multi-step process that connects traditionally disparate worlds.

Metal is automating and streamlining this process. Our vision is to develop a community-driven universal platform capable of orchestrating quantum chip development from concept to fabrication in a simple and open framework.
