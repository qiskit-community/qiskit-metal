# Zlatko:
# Qt Designer doesn't seem to know that in python you can't use self.raise
# since raise is a reserved word.
# Instead, the function is called self.raise_
# Here I used sed on mac to replace it:
#         .raise)    --->    .raise_)
# for the whole file
sed -i '.original' 's/.raise)/.raise_)/g'  main_window_ui.py
 # Remove backup files
rm  main_window_ui.py.original
