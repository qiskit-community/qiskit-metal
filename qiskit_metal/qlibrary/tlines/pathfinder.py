    Non-meandered CPW class that combines A* pathfinding algorithm with
    simple 1-, 2-, or S-shaped segment checks and user-specified anchor points.
    1. A* heap modified to prioritize paths with shortest length_travelled + Manhattan distance to destination.
    2. Checks if connect_simple is valid each time we pop from the heap. If so, use it, otherwise proceed with A*.
    3. Tweaks connect_simple to account for end anchor direction in determining which CPW (elbow or S-segment) to use.

    RouteAnchors Default Options:
        * anchors: OrderedDict -- Intermediate anchors only; doesn't include endpoints
        * advanced: Dict
            * avoid_collision: 'false' -- true/false, defines if the route needs to avoid collisions

    Default Options:
        * step_size: '0.25mm' -- Length of the step for the A* pathfinding algorithm
        * advanced: Dict
            * avoid_collision: 'true' -- true/false, defines if the route needs to avoid collisions
