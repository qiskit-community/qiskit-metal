## In Progress

- We have adopted uv as a project/dependency management tool. 
- Tasks are still run using tox, but with the tox-uv plugin. 
- We adopted ruff for linting and formatting. We have a good starting configuration for linting, but it needs some work before it could be considered stable. 
- The GitHub actions workflows have been updates with these changes. 
    - Python 3.12 is the slowest to build wheels in CI, partly because qutip and pandas take a very long time to build on this version. This needs to be investigated. 
- New developer onboarding instuctions added to `README_developers.md`. The old instructions in`README_developers.md` have been retained with a note for usage on older versions of `qiskit-metal`. 
- Development install instructions have been added to documentation in the "Contributor Guide". 
- Installation instructions have been updates. More updates to come.

### PYAEDT Update

- **FutureWarning**: The `pyaedt` module has been restructured and is now an alias for the new package structure based on `ansys.aedt.core`. To avoid issues in future versions, please update your imports to use the new architecture. Additionally, several files have been renamed to follow the PEP 8 naming conventions. For more information, refer to the [Ansys AEDT documentation](https://aedt.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/release_1_0.html).
