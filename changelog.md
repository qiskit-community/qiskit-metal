### PYAEDT Update

- **FutureWarning**: The `pyaedt` module has been restructured and is now an alias for the new package structure based on `ansys.aedt.core`. To avoid issues in future versions, please update your imports to use the new architecture. Additionally, several files have been renamed to follow the PEP 8 naming conventions. For more information, refer to the [Ansys AEDT documentation](https://aedt.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/release_1_0.html).
