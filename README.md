## Major Update: Upcoming Qiskit Metal Release ðŸš€
We're excited to share that we're nearing the completion of porting Qiskit Metal from PySide2 to PySide6! This update enables native support for M* Macs (Apple Silicon) and includes several other enhancements for the upcoming release. Please take a moment to review and provide feedback on [Pull Request #1002](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-metal/pull/1002) before we proceed with merging and tagging. Your input is invaluable to ensure the release meets everyone's expectations. Thank you for your continued contributions!

## Installation
If you are interested in customizing your experience, or if you are unable to install qiskit-metal using the `pip install` instructions below, consider installing directly the source code, following the instructions in the [documentation](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-metal/installation.html) and/or the [installation instructions for developers](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-metal/blob/main/README_Developers.md).

For normal use, please continue reading.

### The Qiskit Metal deployed package
You can install Qiskit Metal via the pip tool (a python package manager).
```bash
pip install qiskit-metal
```
PIP will handle most of the dependencies automatically and you will always install the latest (and well-tested) version of the package.

Some of the dependencies, namely pyside2 and geopandas, might require manual installation, depending on your specific system compatibility. If you encounter installation or execution errors, please refer first to the [FAQ](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-metal/faq.html).

We recommend to install qiskit-metal in a conda environment or venv, to prevent version conflicts with pre-existing package versions.

### Jupyter Notebook
At this time, we recommend using Jupyter notebook/lab to be able to access all the Qiskit Metal features. Jupyter is not installed with the default dependencies, to accommodate those users intending to utilize a centralized or customized installation.

If you require a fresh installation, please refer to either [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/) or [jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org/install).

Unless you installed the entire `jupyter` package in your current environment, do not forget to create the appropriate kernel to make the environment (thus qiskit-metal) available to jupyter (instructions in the [FAQ](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-metal/faq.html))

## Creating Your First Quantum Component in Qiskit Metal:
Now that Qiskit Metal is installed, it's time to begin working with it.
We are ready to try out a quantum chip example, which is simulated locally using
the Qiskit MetalGUI element. This is a simple example that makes a qubit.
```
$ python
```
```python
>>> from qiskit_metal import designs, draw, MetalGUI, Dict, open_docs
>>> design = designs.DesignPlanar()
>>> design.overwrite_enabled = True
>>> design.chips.main
>>> design.chips.main.size.size_x = '11mm'
>>> design.chips.main.size.size_y = '9mm'
>>> gui = MetalGUI(design)
```
#### Launch the Qiskit Metal GUI to interactively view, edit, and simulate a QDesign:
```python
>>> gui = MetalGUI(design)
```
#### Let's create a new qubit (a transmon) by creating an object of this class.
```python
>>> from qiskit_metal.qlibrary.qubits.transmon_pocket import TransmonPocket
>>> q1 = TransmonPocket(design, 'Q1', options=dict(connection_pads=dict(a=dict())))
>>> gui.rebuild()
>>> gui.edit_component('Q1')
>>> gui.autoscale()
```
#### Change options.
```python
>>> q1.options.pos_x = '0.5 mm'
>>> q1.options.pos_y = '0.25 mm'
>>> q1.options.pad_height = '90um'
>>> q1.options.pad_width  = '455um'
>>> q1.options.pad_gap    = '30 um'
```
#### Update the component geometry after changing the options.
```python
>>> gui.rebuild()
```
![Example_Image!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qiskit/qiskit-metal/main/docs/images/1_1_Birds_eye_view_of_Qiskit_Metal_example_image.jpg 'Example_Image') 
#### Get a list of all the qcomponents in QDesign and then zoom on them.
```python
>>> all_component_names = design.components.keys()
>>> gui.zoom_on_components(all_component_names)
```
#### Closing the Qiskit Metal GUI.
```python
>>> gui.main_window.close()
```

### Core
The **Core** module serves as the backbone of Qiskit Metal, housing essential elements for design and component creation:
- **QLibrary Components**: Predefined library of quantum circuit elements, such as qubits and resonators, that can be used in designs.
- **QDesign**: The central design framework that integrates all components and handles design rules.
- **QComponent**: Base class for all components in the design.
- **QRoute**: Specialized class for managing connections between components.
- **BaseQubit**: Represents foundational qubit structures used in circuit designs.

### Renderers
The **Renderers** module facilitates exporting designs to external tools for electromagnetic simulation and layout rendering:
- **QRenderer**: Base class for all renderers.
- **QRendererGui**: GUI interface for managing renderers.
- Specialized renderers like:
  - **QGDSRenderer**
  - **QAnsysRenderer**
  - **QHFSSRenderer**
  - **QQ3DRenderer**
  - **QPyaedt**
  - **QGmshRenderer**
  - **QElmerRenderer**

These renderers enable integration with industry-standard tools for detailed simulation and fabrication.

### Analyses
The **Analyses** module includes tools for performing simulations and extracting insights from designs:
- **Hamiltonian**: Supports calculations of Hamiltonian parameters.
- **Sweep Options**: Provides tools for parametric sweeps and optimizations.


### GUI
The **GUI** module provides tools for user-friendly interaction with Qiskit Metal. The **MetalGUI** clas is the primary graphical interface for managing designs and visualizations. It is discussed in more depth in the [Architecture Readme](README_Architecture.md).

### Utilities
The **Utilities** module supports the overall functionality of Qiskit Metal by offering supplementary tools.



### Key Interactions
- The **Core** modules form the foundation and integrate tightly with the **Renderers**, **GUI**, and **Analyses** modules.
- The **GUI** depends on the **Core** and **Renderers** to provide visualization and interactivity.
- The **Renderers** serve as bridges between Qiskit Metal and external tools, interacting with the **Core** to export designs.
- The **Analyses** modules leverage the **Core** to extract meaningful data for optimization and validation.
- The **Utilities** modules provide essential supporting functionalities across the entire codebase.

This modular structure ensures scalability, flexibility, and ease of use for designing, analyzing, and fabricating quantum circuits.
